# Music-Player

I have created a music player that works online using javascript, html and CSS.

HTML is the blueprint of the music player.
CSS to add detailing that would make the music player more visually appealing.
Javascript to handle features like the change of song, volumn, fastforward the song, shuffle and repeat.
